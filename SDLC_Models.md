Advantages of Spiral Model: Below are some of the advantages of the Spiral Model
*Risk Handling: The projects with many unknown risks that occur as the development proceeds, in that case,
 Spiral Model is the best development model to follow due to the risk analysis and risk handling at every phase.
*Good for large projects: It is recommended to use the Spiral Model in large and complex projects.
*Flexibility in Requirements: Change requests in the Requirements at later phase can be incorporated accurately by using this model.
*Customer Satisfaction: Customer can see the development of the product at the early phase of the software development and thus,
they habituated with the system by using it before completion of the total product.

Disdvantages of Spiral Model: Below are some of the main disadvantages of the spiral model.
*Complex: The Spiral Model is much more complex than other SDLC models.
*Expensive: Spiral Model is not suitable for small projects as it is expensive.
*Too much dependable on Risk Analysis: The successful completion of the project is very much dependent on Risk Analysis.
 Without very highly experienced expertise, it is going to be a failure to develop a project using this model.
*Difficulty in time management: As the number of phases is unknown at the start of the project, so time estimation is very difficult.

Advantages of Waterfall Model:
*Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed

*Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined
*They should perform quality assurance test (Verification and Validation) before completing each stage
*Elaborate documentation is done at every phase of the software's development cycle
*Project is completely dependent on project team with minimum client intervention
*Any changes in software is made during the process of the development

Disdvantages of Waterfall  Model:
*Error can be fixed only during the phase
*It is not desirable for complex project where requirement changes frequently
*Testing period comes quite late in the developmental process
*Documentation occupies a lot of time of developers and testers
*Clients valuable feedback cannot be included with ongoing development phase
*Small changes or errors that arise in the completed software may cause a lot of problems

Advantages of Iterative Model Model:
*Testing and debugging during smaller iteration is easy.
*A Parallel development can plan.
*It is easily acceptable to ever-changing needs of the project.
*Risks are identified and resolved during iteration.
*Limited time spent on documentation and extra time on designing.

Disdvantages of Iterative Model:
*It is not suitable for smaller projects.
*More Resources may be required.
*Design can be changed again and again because of imperfect requirements.
*Requirement changes can cause over budget.
*Project completion date not confirmed because of changing requirements.
